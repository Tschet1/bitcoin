\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}
Bitcoin is the worlds largest cryptocurrency and is of high interest by research and financial communities and by many individuals around the world. Its fame led to the discovery of various attacks against the bitcoin ecosystem. This thesis contributes to a framework which protects the bitcoin network against routing based isolation attacks. For this, we propose a modified bitcoin client for the use with a switch relay network and show that this new design is able to support multiple thousands of concurrent connections.
