\chapter{\label{summary}Summary}
In this thesis we proposed a modified bitcoin client for the use with the SABRE framework. In chapter \ref{profiling}, we have shown that the current state-of-the-art has bad scaling properties. Using various measurements we were able to gradually pinpoint the bottleneck in scaling up to be the inter-thread communication. We defined properties that a modified bitcoin client should have. We presented a design for a modified bitcoin client that has these properties in in chapter \ref{design}. Additionally, a controller for the switch used in the SABRE network was designed. The shortcomings of the current design and security concerns were briefly discussed in section \ref{sec:design:shortcomings}. Using our prototype, we were able to show the improved scaling properties in chapter \ref{evaluation} by testing our implementation with up to 10'000 connections. We also showed, that the controller has desirable scaling properties in terms of memory usage and CPU overhead and showed the tradeoff between the scalability and the block distribution speed. We concluded this thesis with a short discussion about possible research directions in chapter \ref{outlook}.
