\chapter{\label{outlook}Future Work}
The proposed modifications to the bitcoin client and the design of the controller can be used in the SABRE framework to protect against routing based network isolation attacks. The next step would be to perform a real world experiment using physical hardware for the switch. If this experiment shows promising results, the presented prototype can be used as a starting point for a real world implementation by addressing the design shortcomings mentioned in section \ref{sec:design:shortcomings}.\\
It would be interesting to see if modifications used by FIBRE can be used to improve the SABRE framework in terms of update and distribution speed. Additionally, the update delay of the SABRE framework could be improved by adding support for transactions and compact blocks in a future iteration.\\
Further investigation could be done on the question, if a switch based caching mechanism could also make sense in other areas, for example as network cache in data centers.
